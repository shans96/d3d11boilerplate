# d3d11boilerplate
Files to generate a basic D3D11 application.

Alt-About
======
This project creates a basic Win32 application, and initializes DirectX11 within it (i.e. initializes swap chain and back buffer).

Alt-Compiling
======
Use your preferred compiler of choice to generate an exe. If you're using Visual Studio, just create an empty solution. Then, import the .h files to the "Header Files" section, while the .cpp files get imported into the "Source Files" section. Thereafter, build or debug as normal.
